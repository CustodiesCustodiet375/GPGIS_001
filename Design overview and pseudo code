/* The Ledger */

The ledger is an exchange into which competing reports of events are reduced to contracts and tokens.

There is competition for coverage (Source) and veracity estimates (VE)

Winners of the competion are awarded / broken down into their respective tokens.

These tokens then purchase (by contract) a line code made up of Geo Cordinates + UTC TimeStamp + Threat Code + Threat Level + Description

See Notes below for Time, Threat code and Threat Level and SitRep descriptions and immediate disaster respone Requirement Estimates (IDRRE's)

 

             

             

/*   Notes */

Time Feeds (TFS) have three types

              i. 'web scrapes' taken from timestamp

                                         a. OSINT sit reps

                                         b. News feeds

                                        

              ii. Synchronised server timestamps from Internet of Things (IOT) nearest to event location

             

              iii. Synchronised Reciepient delivery platform

                                         a. Tablet, mobile phone, PC etc.

                                        

Threat Code Feed (TFC)have two types

              i. 'web scrapes' taken from

                                         a. Agency Based (O)pen (S)ource (Int)elligence (TFC_OSINT)

                                         b. Situational Risk Based Analyises (TFC_RBA)

                                        

              ii. (K)ernal (C)anonical (K)ernel (C)anonical (C)orrelation (A)nalysis (KCCA) 'scrapes' from

                                         a. Non Classified, in the public domain, Government Intelligence and security agencies threat code systems TFC_KCCA

                                         b. Non Classified, in the public domain, Military Contractor threat code systems (TFC_MCTS)

 

SitRepDesc Feeds have three types

              i. (G)overnment (A)ppraisal in the (P)ublic (D)omain (GAPD)

              ii (N)ews Corporation (A)nalyis (NPA)

              iii. (S)ocial (N)etwork (A)nalysis of (S)urvivor Report (SNASR)

 

Immediate Disaster Respone Requirement Estimates (IDRRE's)       have many types, and for each type the approriate traained personnel but for version 1 are

              i (H)umaitarian (S)upplies (HS)

              ii (V)ictim (R)escue (E)quipment (VRE)

              iii Victim (M)edical (S)upplies (VMS)

              iv. Victim (R)elocation and (P)rotection (S)upplies
